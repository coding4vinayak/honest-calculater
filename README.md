## Learning outcomes
Learn how to read flowcharts to hone your understanding of loops, conditions, and algorithms. It will allow you to write your own algorithms. This skill also prevents multiple changes from occurring during production.



## Stages:
### :white_check_mark:Stage 1/5: Data Collection
Collect data and check if users were attentive in school.
### :white_check_mark:Stage 2/5: First Calculations
Perform the first calculations and check if users know how to handle zero.
### :white_check_mark:Stage 3/5: Total Recall
Sometimes the numbers are so big that you have to store them. Implement this feature!
